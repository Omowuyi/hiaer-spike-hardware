            N1.0 has threshold=-1, meaning it spikes whenever MP > -1. With no external
            input, N1.0's MP is 0, which is greater than -1, so N1.0 spikes at every single
            time step. After spiking, its MP resets to 0, creating a constant spike source.
            
            Each time N1.0 spikes, it sends a spike to N2.0 with weight=1. N2.0 has
            threshold=0, so it spikes since its MP=1 > 0. This resets the MP of N2.0 to 0. 
            In the subsequent timestep, N2.0 recieves input from N1.0 again so its MP=1
            before spiking again. Thus, N2.0 maintains MP=1 for all timesteps.

        Test Description:
            Validates that the network correctly reads and reports spikes from all
            neurons across a wide range of axonal fanout configurations. This
            tests the spike readout mechanism and verifies proper handling of large
            numbers of simultaneous spikes. The test stops at the first failure.
            
        Network Configuration (varies each iteration):
            - 1 axon (A0) with weight=1 to all N1 neurons
            - Variable number of N1 neurons (1 to 4096): ANN with threshold=0, shift=-17
            - 1 N2 neuron: ANN with threshold=0, shift=-17
            - All N1 neurons connect to N2.0 with weight=1
            
        Test Procedure (for each fanout size):
            Time step 0: Activate A0
            Time step 1: No input (N1 neurons spike)
            Time step 2: No input (N2.0 spikes)
            
        Expected Behavior:
            - Time step 0: No spikes (input propagating)
            - Time step 1: All N1 neurons spike, N2.0 MP = number of N1 neurons
            - Time step 2: N2.0 spikes and resets to MP=0
            
        Explanation:
            At time step 0, A0 activates and its signal propagates to all N1 neurons.
            At time step 1, all N1 neurons (with threshold=0) spike simultaneously,
            each contributing +1 to N2.0's membrane potential. N2.0 accumulates a
            total of (numberN1_neurons * 1). At time step 2, N2.0 spikes and resets.
            This tests the maximum axonal fanout (4096) and validates that spike
            readout works correctly for all fanout sizes up to the hardware limit.
